#Introduction
In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:
1) claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments
2) claims for which additional information is required before approval

Our tasks is to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.
